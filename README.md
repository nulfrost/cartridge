# Cartridge

Cartridge is a website built using the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) to track your video game backlog. There are a lot of similar websites like this one but what makes this one different is that you own your data. So if for some reason this website ceased to exist your backlog would live on, someone would just need to make the UI for your data. This is mostly a project for me to work on in my spare time and to learn more about how the AT Protocol works but also I have a massive game backlog I want to get through. ðŸ˜…

# Technologies

This is the tech stack I chose to go with at this time. It could be that in the future I find something better and switch to it but this is it at this moment.

- React w/ React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- Postgres SQL
- Railway
- (some) Docker

And obviously, working with the AT Protocol to store and retrieve data from a user's [Personal Data Server](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server) (PDS).
